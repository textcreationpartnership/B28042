            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>The Personal Sufferings in the Siege of</hi> London-Derry, <hi>being but generally touch'd in the</hi> Petition <hi>and</hi> Case, <hi>it may not be unfit to take some further View thereof in the Heads that here follow.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">I. THERE was, in the <hi>First</hi> place, in that City, a huge multitude of all sorts, Men, Women, and Children, many of them driven or fled in thither, from all parts, for fear of the Enemy, who having Lost or Abandon'd, or been Robb'd of all they had, though they formerly lived well, had nothing left to Subsist on, nor any where to Lodge, but were forc'd to seek to others (in Distress also themselves) and to depend on their Benevolence and Charity.</p>
            <p n="2">II. WHEN the <hi>Irish</hi> Army drew near to Invest the City, all the chief Officers, and Men of Experience in Martial Affairs, went away, and forsook them, and many more with them for <hi>England,</hi> or else-where; and all the Forces sent over at that time with Collonel <hi>Cunningham</hi> and <hi>Richards</hi> for their Relief, return'd suddenly from thence without Landing, back again to <hi>England,</hi> all looking on the Case of that poor City, and the People therein, as altogether Desperate and Hopeless.</p>
            <p n="3">III. WHEN so many Thousands of People, who lived before in great Plenty, (being there crowded and pent up together within those Walls) were in a little time Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to that <hi>Miserable Want</hi> as to Eat the Vilest of Food, Dogs, Cats, Rats, Horses, Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, Tann'd Hides, Starch, and the like, and many Perished for lack even of that Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sustenance, that could no wise obtain it.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. WHEN at the same time they were Torne asunder, and Destroyed in every part of the City by the Enemies Bombs and Cannon, Death met them at every Corner, and in their Closets and Bed-Chambers, they could be no where Secure: Even Water it self could not be had to many without Hazard of Life.</p>
            <p n="5">V. WHEN at the same time they were swept away daily, in great Numbers, by a malignant Feaver, that then Raged among them, occasion'd from the Base Food, and Ill Lodging, want of Rest, the Noisome Stench and Dismal Sights, Noise of Cannon and Cries of the Sick and Wounded, continual fear of Death or of Famine, or falling into their Enemies hands, the daily Loss of their nearest Relations and Friends before their eyes, whom they were not able to help, nor women to support their poor infants; and other Miseries they were under that cannot be express'd, that they Died so fast, at length, as there could scarce be found room to Interr them, even the Back-sides and Gardens were fill'd up with Graves, and some thrown in Cellars; some whole Families were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely Extinct, and others from many, brought to a very few, and those in a very Misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Condition.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. WHEN at the same time, to the great Grief and Astonishment of those poor People, they beheld the Supplies and Forces sent over from <hi>England</hi> under, the Command of Major-General <hi>Kirke,</hi> for their Relief, lye looking on in their Ships for about Six Weeks together, without ever attempting in the least to Relieve them, though they made all the Signals they could of their being Reduc'd to the very last Extremity, as they truly were at that time, which was greatly Discouraging, and try'd their Patience extreamly.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. WHEN at the same time they were daily offered, by the late King or his Chief Officers there, such Terms and Conditions to Surrender the City, as it could not be thought they would ever have Refus'd; which, notwithstanding all the Miseries they endur'd, and great Danger they were in, and no appearance of Aid, they Rejected to the last; the Cause they Suffer'd for, and great Encouragements they receiv'd from the Proceedings of the <hi>Parliament</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and the Fatal Consequences like to ensue to these Kingdoms, if they gave up the Place, prevailing with them above all Temptations whatever. When after near Four Months Sufferings in that Miserable Condition, it pleased GOD at length to Deliver them, when the Enemy broke up their Siege. But the Besieged had then nothing left to Return to, or Subsist on. And have, many of them, had but a Sorrowful Time ever since, and if not now Reliev'd, must Despair thereof till they Die.</p>
